BPM Song Selector
Part One: 3D Interactive Audio Visualiser 

3D Interactive Audio Visualizer Web-App built with React.js and React Three Fiber. It features a dynamic audio waveform visualizer and an animated 3D model that responds to real-time frequency data from a song. Users can customize colors via a control panel and interact with the 3D scene using orbit controls. The app leverages the Web Audio API for audio analysis, post-processing effects like bloom and LUT for enhanced visuals, and HDR lighting.

Requirements:

1. A text editor (I use Visual Studio Code)

2. Node.js

3. 3D Model in GLTF file format

4. A song/sound file in MP3 Format
